# Imitation_vs_Serendipity

This repository contains the code developed for the paper:

**De Domenico, F., Caccioli, F., Livan, G., Montagna, G., & Nicrosini, O. (2024). _Imitation versus serendipity in ranking dynamics_. Royal Society Open Science, 11(7), 240177.**

The main script, **`simulation.py`**, implements the agent-based model used to study ranking dynamics under different conditions of imitation and serendipity. The code simulates the evolution of agent actions, computes key statistical measures (e.g. Gini coefficient, diversity, utility), and saves results for further analysis.

All key variables discussed in the paper are generated and stored for reproducibility and inspection.
